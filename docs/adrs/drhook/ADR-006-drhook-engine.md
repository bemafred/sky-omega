# ADR-006: DrHook.Engine — Native ICorDebug Replacement for netcoredbg

**Status:** Accepted — 2026-05-21

Emergence 2026-04-17 (Proposed). Scope narrowed 2026-05-19 per [ADR-009](../ADR-009-substrate-dependency-policy.md). **Moved to Accepted 2026-05-21** after the `poc/drhook-engine/` evidence pack (probes 02–06, findings 01–13) validated the entire interop approach end-to-end on macOS/ARM64, BCL-only. This ADR is rewritten from that evidence, not from design intent — every load-bearing decision below has a probe behind it.

## Context

DrHook v1 wraps **netcoredbg** (Samsung, MIT, separate-process DAP server). Its macOS/ARM64 func-eval deadlock — a netcoredbg-localized implementation gap, **not** a CoreCLR limitation (corrected 2026-05-17; vsdbg and Rider both honor conditional breakpoints on the same CoreCLR) — gutted `drhook_step_eval` and watch-mode. netcoredbg's macOS/ARM64 maintenance has been dormant since 2023. Wrapping an externally-maintained debugger means DrHook's reliability tracks theirs; that ceiling is reachable.

[ADR-009](../ADR-009-substrate-dependency-policy.md)'s four-axis admission rule resolved DrHook's two external artifacts asymmetrically:

| Dependency | Origin | Shape | Stability | Replaceability | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Microsoft.Diagnostics.NETCore.Client` | `dotnet/diagnostics` (runtime-team-adjacent) | Extends — Diagnostic IPC + EventPipe access | `DOTNET_IPC_V1` magic + semver | Reimplementable from public spec | **Admitted** (managed dependency) |
| `libdbgshim` | `dotnet/diagnostics` (native asset) | Native shim to `ICorDebug` — part of the .NET debugging substrate | wire/ABI stable | n/a — platform | **Platform** (native runtime-substrate asset, faces no axes) |
| netcoredbg | Samsung (third-party) | Imposes DAP-server + ICorDebug-consumer architecture | dormant macOS/ARM64 | replaceable as the substrate work | **Excluded** (fails axes 1, 2, 3) |

The substrate-independence claim is paid by replacing the **excluded** dependency. The engine work is the **Layer 3 ICorDebug interop** — the layer that actually fails the policy.

## Drivers

1. **Substrate independence via netcoredbg replacement.** Own the ICorDebug surface; let the runtime-team-adjacent diagnostic client handle the wire-protocol layers it's purpose-built for.
2. **Failure ownership where it counts.** The func-eval deadlock cost a workstream. Native ICorDebug makes that class of bug ours to fix, not ours to work around.
3. **Platform reach.** netcoredbg's macOS/ARM64 bitrot generalizes to any future platform shift. Native interop tracks BCL + ICorDebug's documented ABI instead.
4. **Tractability — now proven.** The PoC demonstrated the full interop surface works BCL-only. The remaining work is bounded debugger-feature engineering, not open-ended research.

## Decision

Build **DrHook.Engine** under `src/DrHook.Engine/`, replacing netcoredbg with native ICorDebug interop. The DrHook MCP surface (tool names, schemas) is unchanged; the engine is swapped underneath.

### Dependency boundary (per ADR-009)

- **`Microsoft.Diagnostics.NETCore.Client` (managed, admitted)** — Diagnostic IPC client (`DiagnosticsClient`, `GetProcessInfo`, EventPipe session control) and EventPipe NetTrace decoding (`EventPipeSession`/`EventPipeEventSource`). Layers 1–2. Characterized at [`findings/01`](../../../poc/drhook-engine/findings/01-ipc-protocol-survey.md) for axis-4 walk-back.
- **`libdbgshim` (native, platform)** — the shim bridging to `ICorDebug`. Not in the .NET runtime install for .NET 7+ (it moved to `dotnet/diagnostics`); the engine **bundles** it from the `Microsoft.Diagnostics.DbgShim[.<rid>]` NuGet (`runtimes/<rid>/native/`). **Baseline: `Microsoft.Diagnostics.DbgShim.osx-arm64` 9.0.661903** (the 9.0.x tooling line is forward-compatible — it debugged a .NET 10 target; bump when a 10.0.x ships). [Finding 11](../../../poc/drhook-engine/findings/11-dbgshim-baseline.md).
- **netcoredbg** — removed. Zero spawns is the substrate-independence bar.

### The interop model (VALIDATED — the central design decision)

The PoC established an **asymmetry** between calling ICorDebug and being called back by it. This is the load-bearing engineering decision and it is evidence-grounded:

- **Consume direction (we call ICorDebug / ICorDebugController / ICorDebugProcess):** **source-generated COM** — `[GeneratedComInterface]` interfaces consumed as RCWs via `StrategyBasedComWrappers.GetOrCreateObjectForComInstance`. BCL (`System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshalling`), `[PreserveSig] int` on every method for explicit HRESULT control. Validated: probes 02/03/05/06 called `Initialize`, `Terminate`, `SetManagedHandler`, `DebugActiveProcess`, `Continue`, `Detach` this way.
- **Receive direction (mscordbi calls our `ICorDebugManagedCallback`):** a **hand-rolled `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` function-pointer vtable** — **NOT** a `[GeneratedComClass]` ComWrappers CCW. This corrects the pre-PoC assumption (the 2026-04-17/05-19 drafts said "ComWrappers is the substrate-aligned interop surface" — *that is false for the callback direction*).

  **Evidence (findings 09/10/12/13):** a `[GeneratedComClass]` CCW registered fine (`SetManagedHandler` → `S_OK`, probe 04) but the runtime **never delivered** a callback to it (probe 05 — zero callbacks across parked/live targets, 15s). A hand-rolled `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` vtable **received `CreateProcess`** on mscordbi's event thread (probe 06). The native→managed transition on mscordbi's thread *works* (our thunk ran managed code there); the failure was specifically **ComWrappers object-CCW dispatch** (its `ComInterfaceDispatch.GetInstance` lookup + reference-tracking doesn't function in the debug-callback context). The raw thunk has no such lookup and sidesteps it.

  Construction: the engine builds the `ICorDebugManagedCallback`(+2/3/4) vtable from `[UnmanagedCallersOnly(CallConvs=[CallConvCdecl])]` static thunks (38 methods), in exact IDL order (a misordered slot crashes when the runtime calls it). A native COM object block holds the four vtable pointers; `QueryInterface` hands out the right sub-object per IID. For instance state, the thunk recovers `this` from the COM object block (generalizing probe 06's static-state approach).

### Attach flow (VALIDATED — corrected from desktop-.NET assumptions)

```
EnumerateCLRs(pid)   [RETRY: 100ms × 30; INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE = coreclr mid-load, retry]
    → pStringArray[0] is a coreclr MODULE PATH (not a version string)
CreateVersionStringFromModule(pid, modulePath, …)  → opaque version token
CreateDebuggingInterfaceFromVersionEx(CorDebugVersion_4_0 = 4, token, &pUnknown)
QueryInterface(IID_ICorDebug)  → typed ICorDebug
Initialize() → SetManagedHandler(vtable) → DebugActiveProcess(pid, FALSE, &pProcess)
    [process RUNS after attach — an explicit Continue here is CORDBG_E_SUPERFLOUS_CONTINUE]
… callbacks delivered on mscordbi's event thread; drive a continue-loop (CallbacksQueue pattern) …
Detach() → Terminate()
```

All strings UTF-16 (`WCHAR` = `char16_t` on the PAL). [Finding 04](../../../poc/drhook-engine/findings/04-netcoredbg-reference.md) corrected the flow; finding 02 had it partly wrong from the header alone.

**macOS attach needs no debug entitlement** — `DebugActiveProcess` from a plain `dotnet` build attached to another .NET process, no codesigning ([finding 13](../../../poc/drhook-engine/findings/13-probe-06-outcome.md); same-user targets; cross-user/SIP-protected untested). This removes the largest deployment unknown.

### Type mapping

Native ↔ .NET integer mapping is governed by the PAL's fixed-size typedefs ([finding 08](../../../poc/drhook-engine/findings/08-com-type-mapping.md)): `LONG`/`ULONG`/`DWORD`/`BOOL`/`HRESULT`/enums → `int`/`uint` (32-bit, locked by the PAL under LP64 — **never** `LONG` → C# `long`); `*_PTR`/`SIZE_T` → `nint`/`nuint`; `CORDB_ADDRESS`/`ULONG64` → `ulong`; `WCHAR` → `char`; interface/`WCHAR*`/`BYTE*` params → `nint`.

### Integration

DrHook.Core exposes stepping/observation APIs; DrHook.Engine implements the native ICorDebug interop beneath. `ProcessAttacher` delegates to `DiagnosticsClient` (admitted NuGet) for process metadata; the stepping path delegates to the engine's ICorDebug client. The DAP outward surface to MCP/IDE consumers can remain or be replaced — an integration decision separate from the engine.

## Consequences

**Gained (validated):**
- Native control over the ICorDebug surface; zero spawns of an externally-maintained debugger.
- **BCL-only callback layer confirmed viable** — no native C/C++ shim required; the `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` vtable keeps the receive direction in managed code. Substrate independence holds for the engine's hardest layer.
- Attach with an ordinary build on macOS/ARM64 — no entitlement.
- Platform-portability tracks BCL + ICorDebug's documented ABI.

**Lost / traded:**
- Engineering investment concentrated in Layer 3 (COM interop, the 38-method vtable, lifetime management, the continue-loop).
- Functional parity with netcoredbg's mature feature set must be rebuilt on the layer we own.
- The callback vtable is hand-rolled (38 thunks in exact order) — a transcription-discipline surface; mitigated by fixture-replay testing.

**Out of scope:**
- Native reimplementation of Layers 1–2 (admitted dependencies; an ADR-009 amendment, not this ADR).
- Replacing the MCP SDK (ADR-003). Supporting non-.NET runtimes. Changing the DAP wire surface.

## Continuous Observation Surface (added 2026-04-17)

DrHook today is request/response. Activity Monitor raises the adjacent question: a deep, continuously-refreshing observation surface for .NET processes — GC heap, assemblies, JIT state, per-thread managed/native split. **In scope, .NET only.** Non-.NET processes are out of scope (others build adapters for their stack; the naming principle holds — DrHook is *the .NET substrate*).

- **Tier 1 (BCL + admitted NuGet):** per-process CPU% (`Process.TotalProcessorTime` deltas), memory breakdown, module list (`Process.Modules` + EventPipe `AssemblyLoader`), process tree (`kinfo_proc`/`/proc`), streaming/poll MCP surface (`drhook_watch`/`drhook_monitor`).
- **Tier 2 (macOS P/Invoke, shares the mach scaffolding with Layer 3):** per-thread CPU/state/native+managed stack (`task_threads`, `thread_info`), disk I/O (`proc_pidinfo`), open FDs (`proc_pidfdinfo`).
- **Tier 3 (private APIs):** per-process network, energy, GPU — out of scope, leave to the OS tool.

## Open Questions

1. ~~dbgshim API surface~~ **RESOLVED** by the PoC — the attach flow is characterized and validated (findings 02/04, probes 02–06).
2. **Func-eval design — RESOLVED: func-eval WORKS in our engine (probe 19, finding 27).** The deadlock was always netcoredbg-localized, and we proved it: `ICorDebugEval.CallFunction` ran `Probe.Answer()` in the debuggee and returned 42, 4/4, no deadlock, on macOS/ARM64. So the design is **option A (use func-eval) combined with a Roslyn front end**: Roslyn parses the C# expression → method/property calls execute via func-eval in the debuggee → ICorDebug reads locals/args → result. This gives full standard-C# expressions (the LLM consumer writes ordinary C#, no custom dialect) and makes DrHook.Engine strictly more capable than netcoredbg, which could not eval on this platform. (Client-side eval — old option C — remains a lightweight fast-path for primitive-only conditions, but is no longer the ceiling.) Remaining: func-eval breadth (args, instance methods, `CallParameterizedFunction`), reference results, `ICorDebugEval::Abort` + timeout as the safety net for a genuinely hung eval, and the Roslyn integration.
3. **Windows support.** ICorDebug COM interop is platform-conditional (Windows COM activation vs Unix dbgshim flat entry points). Working assumption: Unix-first; Windows in v2 once the idiom is established. (The `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` vtable approach should port; Windows uses the same vtable model.)
4. **Continue-loop shape.** Each delivered callback synchronizes (stops) the process; the engine must `Continue` to proceed, per the netcoredbg `CallbacksQueue` pattern (finding 12). The PoC validated single-event delivery + detach; the production continue-loop (queue events, continue, handle stop-state) is Phase 2 engineering.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — PoC validation ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-18 → 2026-05-21)
`poc/drhook-engine/`, findings 01–13. Probe 02 (dbgshim attach + QI), 03 (source-gen COM consume + lifecycle), 04 (callback V-table registration), 05 (attach + detach, no entitlement; CCW delivery blocked), 06 (`[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` vtable receives callbacks — A2). The interop model is proven.

### Phase 1 — Engine project scaffolding ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-21)
- [x] `src/DrHook.Engine/` project, in `SkyOmega.sln`, refs admitted `Microsoft.Diagnostics.NETCore.Client`. Builds warning-clean under `TreatWarningsAsErrors`. (`libdbgshim` native-asset *bundling* deferred — `DbgShim.cs` uses a resilient resolver: `DBGSHIM_PATH` → app base → runtime dir → NuGet cache.)
- [x] dbgshim load + corrected attach flow — `Interop/DbgShim.cs`
- [x] source-gen COM RCW interfaces — `Interop/CorDebug.cs` (`ICorDebug`, `ICorDebugController`; `ICorDebugProcess` deferred to Phase 2 when its methods are needed)
- [x] `ICorDebugManagedCallback`(+2/3/4) `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` vtable with **instance dispatch** (GCHandle recovery from the COM block) — `Interop/ManagedCallbackHost.cs`. Validated end-to-end via a `DebugSession` smoke test: attach → `CreateProcess` callback delivered → detach.
- [x] observation facade — `Observation/ProcessInspector.cs` wraps the admitted `DiagnosticsClient` (Layer-1 .NET-process discovery via `GetPublishedProcesses`) + BCL `System.Diagnostics.Process` (Tier-1 metrics: working set, threads, CPU time, native module count). 3 self-inspection tests. Managed-assembly enumeration via EventPipe (Layer 2 / TraceEvent — a separate ADR-009 admission) is a follow-up.
- [x] in-process layer tests (testability-first, primary surface per `docs/limits/drhook-testability.md`) — `tests/DrHook.Engine.Tests` drives the callback vtable *in-process*, the test playing the native caller: QI multi-interface dispatch, V-table slot layout (`CreateProcess`@9, `FunctionRemapOpportunity`@v2-3), and GCHandle instance recovery (two hosts route to their own sinks). 5 tests, deterministic, no debuggee/dbgshim. (Live-debuggee integration smoke + recorded callback-fixture replay remain as on-top follow-ups.)

`DebugSession`/`IDebugEventSink` (`DebugSession.cs`, `IDebugEventSink.cs`) compose the validated pieces into the attach/detach lifecycle.

### Phase 2 — Stepping primitives
- [x] continue-loop / CallbacksQueue (finding 12 pattern) — `CallbackPump.cs`. The callback thunks enqueue + return S_OK on mscordbi's event thread; a background worker drains, surfaces each event to the user sink, then `Continue`s for the next. `DebugSession.Attach` constructs the pump, hands it to `ManagedCallbackHost` as the sink, and calls `pump.Start(() => controller.Continue(0))` once the controller exists; `Dispose` joins the worker before Detach (it drives `Continue`). 4 in-process drain tests (backlog-before-start, post-start steady state, one-Continue-per-event, late-event-after-dispose dropped). The tests surfaced + fixed two production defects: non-idempotent `Dispose` and an `OnEvent` swallow clause too narrow for the disposed-queue shutdown state. **Live-validated by probe 07** (`07-continue-loop-smoke.cs` + `07-target.cs`, finding 14): against a target flooding managed events, the assembled engine drained **591 callbacks in 4 s** (one `Continue` per synchronized stop) — Phase 1's single-event ceiling (probe 05 saw 0 from a parked target) is gone.
- [x] **"stopping" event handling in the pump** — the keystone for breakpoints + stepping. Callbacks are classified (`CallbackKind`, host→pump via `IManagedCallbackSink`): informational events auto-continue as before; the three STOPPING callbacks (Breakpoint, StepComplete, Break) suppress the auto-Continue, leave the debuggee synchronized, and surface a `StopInfo`. `CallbackPump` parks the worker on a stop until the caller resumes; `DebugSession` exposes `WaitForStop(timeout)` / `Resume()`. 4 new in-process tests (stop suppresses Continue until Resume; stops don't leak into the informational firehose; ExitProcess wakes a waiter; no-stop returns null). **Live-validated by probe 09** (`09-stopping-model-smoke.cs` + `09-break-target.cs`, finding 16): a `Debugger.Break()` target stops on each Break, stays frozen while held (0 stops in a 400 ms window — vs ~20 if auto-continued), and advances only on `Resume` — 5 controlled stops, 3/3 runs.
- [ ] breakpoints (`ICorDebugFunctionBreakpoint`), stepping (over/into/out), stack frames + variables (direct inspection, no func-eval v1) — produce stopping events that ride the model above; needs `ICorDebugModule`/`Function`/`Code`/`FunctionBreakpoint`/`Stepper`/`Frame`/`Value` + metadata resolution. Sub-increments:
  - [x] **4a navigation** — `RuntimeNavigation` walks process→app domains→assemblies→modules via **raw V-table calls (slot numbers only, no GUIDs)**; `DebugSession.EnumerateModules()` (valid at a stop). **Probe 10** (finding 17): 8 modules listed at a Break stop incl. CoreLib + the target's own module, 2/2. Slots validated: EnumerateAppDomains@26, EnumerateAssemblies@14, EnumerateModules@5, GetName@6, Enum.Next@7.
  - [x] **4b metadata** — `MetadataResolver` via `ICorDebugModule.GetMetaDataInterface`@14 (passing `IID_IMetaDataImport`, the one unavoidable GUID — an *input*, fails cleanly if wrong) → `IMetaDataImport`; `FindTypeDefByName`@9 + `EnumMethodsWithName`@19 → `mdMethodDef`; `CloseEnum`@3. `DebugSession.ResolveMethodToken(moduleSubstr, type, method)`. **Probe 11** (finding 18): `Worker.Tick` → `0x06000003` (table 0x06), bogus name → 0, 2/2. (Probe caught a target-side race — single startup `Debugger.Break()` raced attach; fixed by waiting for `Debugger.IsAttached`.)
  - [x] **4c breakpoint** — `Breakpoints.TryCreate`: `ICorDebugModule.GetFunctionFromToken`@9 → `ICorDebugFunction.CreateBreakpoint`@8 (function entry) → `ICorDebugBreakpoint.Activate`@3. `DebugSession.SetBreakpoint(moduleSubstr, type, method)` composes 4a+4b+4c; (module, function, breakpoint) pointers kept alive, released on Dispose. **Probe 12** (finding 19): breakpoint on `Worker.Tick` hit **5×**, frozen between hits, advancing only on `Resume` — the hit rides the stopping model as `StopReason.Breakpoint`; hit path 9/9. (Caught an intermittent teardown exit-race — mscordbi's `ExitProcessWorkItem` racing detach when the target is killed; finding-14 class, mitigated by kill-first teardown; [`docs/limits/drhook-detach-exit-race.md`](../../limits/drhook-detach-exit-race.md). Deactivating breakpoints before detach was tried and falsified.)
  - [x] **stepping (over/into/out)** — `Stepping.Arm`: `ICorDebugThread.CreateStepper`@12 → `ICorDebugStepper.Step`@7 (into/over) / `StepOut`@9. The pump's resume generalized to `ResumeKind {Continue,StepInto,StepOver,StepOut}`; the resume handler arms the stepper on the captured `_stopThread` then Continues. `DebugSession.StepInto/StepOver/StepOut`. Completion rides the stopping model as `StopReason.Step` (no new callback wiring). **Probe 13** (finding 20): stop at a breakpoint, `StepOver` 3×, each a `StopReason.Step`, 3/3. v1 is IL-granularity (source-line stepping needs PDB ranges — later).
  - [x] **stack frames** — `Frames.WalkManagedFrames`: `ICorDebugThread.GetActiveFrame`@15 + chase `ICorDebugFrame.GetCaller`@8; per frame `GetFunctionToken`@6 + `GetFunction`@5→`GetModule`@3 → `MetadataResolver.MethodName` (reverse of 4b: `GetMethodProps`@30 + `GetTypeDefProps`@12 → "Type.Method"). `DebugSession.GetStackFrames()` (stop thread surfaced via `CallbackPump.StopThread`). **Probe 14** (finding 21): at the `Worker.Tick` breakpoint the stack reads `#0 Worker.Tick`, `#1 Program.<Main>$`, 2/2 — answers "where did we stop". IL offset per frame (GetIP via ILFrame) deferred.
  - [x] **variables (arguments)** — `Variables.ReadActiveFrameArguments`: `GetActiveFrame`@15 → QI `ICorDebugILFrame` (IID `03E26311`) → `GetArgument`@16 → `ICorDebugValue.GetType`@3 + QI `ICorDebugGenericValue` (IID `CC7BCAF8`) `GetValue`@7. `DebugSession.GetArguments()` → `ArgumentValue`(elementType, raw?). **Probe 15** (finding 22): at `Worker.Compute(int n, long total)` called `(7,100)` reads `this`(Class), `n=7`(I4), `total=100`(I8), 3/3. IIDs taken from the authoritative cordebug.idl (a wrong-IID attempt failed *gracefully* — QI null, no crash); also flushed out the file-based-app stale-cache hazard. Refinements deferred: local names (PDB), reference dereferencing, typed rendering.

**Phase 2 inspection complete — `DebugSession` answers *where* (`GetStackFrames`) and *with what* (`GetArguments`) at any stop. The full interactive-debug loop (attach → breakpoints → step → inspect frames + args) works BCL-only, no netcoredbg.**

**Symbols (names + lines) — the load-bearing layer for source locations + conditional breakpoints/eval (the netcoredbg gap):**
- [x] **6a SymbolReader** — `SymbolReader.TryOpen(modulePath)` reads a module's Portable PDB (embedded or sidecar `.pdb`) via `System.Reflection.Metadata` — **pure managed, BCL-only**: verified present in the net10.0 *ref pack*, so no PackageReference and no ADR-009 dependency decision. `TryGetLine(token, ilOffset)` → `SourceLocation(file, line)` from sequence points; `GetLocalNames(token)` → slot→name from local scopes. **Unit-validated** (finding 23) against the test assembly's own PDB — file-based ⇒ deterministic, CI-safe, no debuggee: finds the PDB, reads named locals (`doubled`/`widened`), maps entry → source, rejects non-method tokens. 21 tests green.
  - [x] **6b source lines in stack frames** — `Frames.WalkManagedFrames` returns structured `FrameInfo` (method, module path, token, IL offset via `ICorDebugILFrame.GetIP`@11); `DebugSession.GetStackFrames` resolves each through a per-module `SymbolReader` cache → `Type.Method @ file:line`. **Probe 16** (finding 24): at the `Worker.Tick` breakpoint the stack reads `#0 Worker.Tick @ 11-bp-target.cs:28`, `#1 Program.<Main>$ @ 11-bp-target.cs:19`, 2/2.
  - [x] **6c source-line breakpoints** — `SymbolReader.TryFindLine(fileHint, line)` reverse-maps to `(token, IL offset)` (nearest sequence point ≥ line); `Breakpoints.TryCreateAtOffset` binds via `ICorDebugFunction.GetILCode`@6 → `ICorDebugCode.CreateBreakpoint(offset)`@7 → `Activate`@3. `DebugSession.SetBreakpointAtLine(moduleSubstr, fileHint, line)`. **Probe 17** (finding 25): a breakpoint at the mid-method statement `17-line-target.cs:31` bound and hit exactly there (`Worker.Step @ 17-line-target.cs:31`), 2/2 — not just function entry.
  - [x] **6d locals by name** — `DebugSession.GetLocals()` joins PDB names (`SymbolReader.GetLocalNames`) with values read via `ICorDebugILFrame.GetLocalVariable`@14 (decoded like args, 5b). **Probe 18** (finding 26): at a line breakpoint in `Worker.Step(5)`, reads `a`(I4)=6, `b`(I8)=60, 2/2. **Symbols arc 6a–6d complete** — the engine answers *where* (`Type.Method @ file:line`), *with what* (named/typed args + locals), and stops *where you point* (`file:line` breakpoints), all BCL-only.
  - [~] conditional breakpoints / expression evaluation — **first slice DONE** (probe 22, finding 30): standard-C# conditions over primitive locals. Engine is BCL-only — `IEvalContext` (locals/args snapshot) + `DebugSession.WaitForConditionalStop(Func<IEvalContext,bool>, timeout)` (evaluate at each breakpoint hit; resume-if-false). The **Roslyn front end** (parse + tree-walk → predicate) lives above the engine (validated in the probe via `#:package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp`); `value == 3` stopped exactly when it held, 2/2. netcoredbg couldn't do conditional breakpoints on this platform — DrHook.Engine does. **Member-access conditions validated** — probe 23 (finding 31): a predicate that func-evals `s.Length > 3` inside `WaitForConditionalStop` stops at exactly the right iteration, 2/2; the feared func-eval/conditional-loop re-entrancy was a false alarm (the initial hang was a local-vs-arg setup bug, not a deadlock). **General member resolution DONE** (probe 24, finding 32): `MemberResolver.ResolveGetter` derives a value's runtime class (`ReferenceValue.Dereference`@10 → `ObjectValue.GetClass`@7 → `Class.GetModule`@3/`GetToken`@4) and finds `get_<member>` via `MetadataResolver.FindMethodInType` — `box.Size = 42` resolved with no hardcoded type/module, 2/2. **Member-access walker DONE** (probe 25, finding 34): the Roslyn walker's `MemberAccessExpressionSyntax` arm calls `TryEvalMemberCall`, so a fully-parsed `box.Size == 42` is a real conditional breakpoint — parse → walk → resolve getter on runtime type → func-eval → compare — that stopped exactly when it held across a cycling 40..44 gate, 2/2, nothing about `Box` hardcoded. **Breakpoint-types model** (finding 33): VS / VS Code / Rider factor into four orthogonal axes — **location · gates · action · suspend** — and a *logpoint* ("logs but doesn't stop") is the `(action=log) × (suspend=none)` corner, not a new breakpoint type (DAP confirms: `logMessage != null` *is* the logpoint). It already half-lives in `WaitForConditionalStop` — the resume-if-false leaf *is* suspend=none. Forward: a composed `BreakpointPolicy` (condition + hit-count gates, a log action that reuses this same walker to interpolate `{expr}` fragments, Suspend ∈ {All, None}) makes conditional breakpoints and logpoints two configurations of one policy (composed capabilities, not a `bool` mode flag). Remaining: the `ICorDebugType`/`GetExactType`@3 path for strings/arrays/generics (plain objects work, strings don't via `ObjectValue`); fields (`GetFieldValue`@8); resolving `this` from arguments; chained access (`a.b.c`); per-breakpoint conditions; and extracting the front end to a `DrHook.Engine.Expressions` package.
- [x] **clean-detach quiescence** — `DebugSession.Quiesce()` calls `ICorDebugController::Stop` before `Detach`, synchronizing the process so no callback flush is in flight when the shim is torn down. **Live-validated by probe 08** (`08-quiesce-detach-smoke.cs`, finding 15): disposing while the target is still flooding — the probe-07 crash scenario — detaches cleanly 3/3 and leaves the target running. Minimal `Stop` sufficed; the proposed `SetAllThreadsDebugState`/`HasQueuedCallbacks` escalation was not needed. Resolves [`docs/limits/drhook-clean-detach.md`](../../limits/drhook-clean-detach.md) (finding 14).
- [ ] regression: DrHook stepping tools pass without netcoredbg

### Phase 3 — Switchover

Substrate gaps to back the MCP `drhook_step_*` tools on DrHook.Engine (per the "what's left" assessment after finding 39):

- [x] **AsyncBreak / `DebugSession.Pause`** (probe 31, finding 40): `ICorDebugController.Stop(0)` routed through the pump as a synthetic `CallbackKind.PauseRequest` stopping event so the existing `_resume.Take` rendezvous handles it uniformly — the worker stays the sole caller of `Stop` and `Continue`. `StopReason.Pause` surfaces via `WaitForStop`. Two cycles validated; one in-process unit test added (47 pass). Backs `drhook_step_pause`.
- [ ] **Launch** — `DebugSession.Launch(program, args, …)` via `ICorDebug::CreateProcess`. Backs `drhook_step_run` and (via VSTEST_HOST_DEBUG PID discovery + Attach) `drhook_step_test`.
- [x] **Breakpoint registry** (probe 32, finding 41): `SetBreakpoint`/`SetBreakpointAtLine` return positive ids (0 = failed); `ListBreakpoints` returns typed `BreakpointInfo` (`LineBreakpointInfo`/`FunctionBreakpointInfo` subtypes — pattern-matchable, no optional-fields-with-Kind-enum); `RemoveBreakpoint(id)` deactivates (`ICorDebugBreakpoint.Activate(FALSE)`) + releases; `ClearBreakpoints` does the live form for all (Dispose skips deactivation because Terminate already invalidated). All 14 existing probes updated to the int-return shape via one `sed` pass. Backs `drhook_step_breakpoint_list`/`_remove`/`_clear`.
- [ ] **Persistent exception filter** — `ArmExceptionFilter(typeName, kind)` so subsequent `WaitForStop`/`WaitForPolicyStop` surfaces matching exceptions; generalizes the per-call `WaitForExceptionPolicyStop`. Backs `drhook_step_break_exception`.
- [ ] **Object inspection (depth ≥ 1 with reference fields)** — `ICorDebugValue2::GetExactType`@3 + `ObjectValue::GetFieldValue`@8 + string/array rendering. The recurring reference-typed-results gap (findings 32/37 scope notes). Unlocks `ex.Message`, real `drhook_step_vars` output, and depth-walked inspection. Longest pole.

Integration:

- [ ] `SteppingSessionManager` rewrite (~1173 lines today; new version ~400 LOC since DAP wire-protocol plumbing disappears) backed by `DebugSession`. Preserve JSON response shapes so consumers don't break.
- [ ] regression: DrHook stepping tools pass without netcoredbg — per-tool integration suite (the existing probe targets cover most). Optional `DRHOOK_BACKEND=engine|netcoredbg` fallback flag during convergence (the ADR's "opt-in fallback") for side-by-side parity runs.
- [ ] retire netcoredbg + remove `Microsoft.Diagnostics.NETCore.Client` if `ProcessAttacher` can use dbgshim's process enumeration (likely yes — same native asset the engine already loads). Update CLAUDE.md / README to reflect engine-only.

### Phase 4 — Func-eval (Open Question 2)
- [x] **viability decided — func-eval WORKS** (probe 19, finding 27): `ICorDebugEval.CallFunction` of a static method completed with the right result, 4/4, no deadlock on macOS/ARM64. The netcoredbg deadlock was netcoredbg-specific. Decision: **option A (func-eval) + Roslyn front end** for full C# expressions.
- [x] **breadth: arguments** — `Eval.CreateInt32` (`CreateValue`@12 + `GenericValue.SetValue`@8) + `CallFunction`@3 with `ppArgs`. **Probe 20** (finding 28): `Probe.Doubled(21) = 42`, 2/2. Instance methods now reduce to `args[0] = this` (a read value, finding 26) — composition, not a new unknown.
- [x] **breadth: instance methods / properties** — `this` from a read local (`Variables.GetActiveFrameLocalValue`), method resolved on its declaring module, `CallWithOneArg(func, this)`. **Probe 21** (finding 29): `s.Length` (`String.get_Length` on the local `s="hello"`) = 5, 2/2 — including cross-module (CoreLib) resolution. The realistic conditional case (`s.Length`, `list.Count`) is covered.
- [ ] breadth: reference-typed *results* (dereference a returned string/object to render it — the *call* works, rendering the returned ref is the gap), `CallParameterizedFunction` for generics.
- [~] safety: `ICorDebugEval::Abort` wired into the eval timeout path (probe 20); validation under a *real* target-side hang is still to do.
- [x] Roslyn integration: parse a C# expression → walk → predicate, for **primitive locals** (probe 22, finding 30) and **member access** (probe 25, finding 34 — `box.Size == 42`). The walker closes over `DebugSession`; a `MemberAccessExpressionSyntax` arm calls `TryEvalMemberCall` (getter func-eval'd on the runtime type). **Extended for interpolated log messages** (probe 29, finding 39): the same `Eval` core also produces `Func<IEvalContext, string>` from a Roslyn-parsed `$"…"` — `{2*v}` fragments are evaluated and stringified. One front end, two consumers (bool conditions + string log renderers). **Extended for the `ex` operand** (probe 30, finding 39): `ex.X` routes to `TryEvalCurrentExceptionMember` at exception stops. Remaining breadth: chained / `this`-from-arguments operands, the `ICorDebugType` path for strings/arrays/generics, fields, and set-time parse-diagnostics rejection.
- [x] **`BreakpointPolicy` DONE** (probe 28, finding 38): condition + hit-count gates (`HitCountMode.Equals/AtLeast/Multiple`), `LogMessage` action emitted as a structured `LogRecord` via the widened `IDebugEventSink.OnLog` (default interface method), Suspend ∈ {All, None}. `DebugSession.WaitForPolicyStop(policy, timeout)` generalizes `WaitForConditionalStop`. Four configurations validated against ONE target/breakpoint: conditional breakpoint (`v == 3` surfaces), logpoint (68 lines in 2 s, never surfaces), hit-count-gated logpoint (`Equals(3)` — exactly one log line in the window; sampling), fault (`ConditionError` + `IsFault` `LogRecord` — finding 35 tri-state). Surfaced + fixed an engine flaw: per-stop `timeout` made a fast-hitting Suspend.None logpoint loop forever — both `WaitForPolicyStop` and `WaitForConditionalStop` are now deadline-based; probe 22 still passes (no regression). **Extended to the EXCEPTION location** (probe 30, finding 39): `WaitForExceptionPolicyStop(typeName, policy, timeout)` filters by type and runs the SAME `EvaluatePolicy` core (factored out as a private helper, shared with `WaitForPolicyStop` so fault/log/suspend behave identically across locations). The walker's `ex` operand routes to `TryEvalCurrentExceptionMember`. Three configs validated: conditional ex-bp, ex-logpoint (110 lines in 2 s), ex-fault. **Host-side sink delivered** (finding 39): `BoundedLogSink` — a fixed-capacity, thread-safe ring-buffer `IDebugEventSink` with `Drain` returning `(records, droppedCount)` — the default destination for logpoint output. 46 unit tests pass (15 `HitCountGate.Admits` + 9 `BoundedLogSink` + 22 prior). Future Suspend axis: per-thread; future filter axis on ex-policy: first-chance vs unhandled; future location axes: data/field watchpoints, dependent breakpoints.
- [x] **error feedback — tri-state condition outcome DONE** (finding 38, delivered in `BreakpointPolicy`): the engine wraps the condition delegate in try/catch — a throw surfaces a distinct `StopReason.ConditionError` plus a `LogRecord` with `IsFault: true` carrying the exception message; never silently false. Log interpolation is best-effort (a faulting `{expr}` renders inline, the line still emits). Validated by probe 28 config D. Roslyn `GetDiagnostics()` set-time parse validation is the remaining follow-on (one front end above the engine).
- [x] **structured log sink DONE** (finding 38, delivered in `BreakpointPolicy`): `IDebugEventSink.OnLog(LogRecord)` added as a default interface method; engine emits `LogRecord(TimestampUtc, Message, IsFault)` and chooses no destination. Hit-count gate doubles as sampling (config C: `Equals(3)` ⇒ exactly one line in ~100 hits). Host destinations (ring buffer drained by `drhook_log_drain`, file tee, Mercury observations) are the next consumer in `DrHook.Mcp`.
- [ ] **exception breakpoints — a distinct location axis** (finding 35): model = type filter (±subclasses) × first-chance/unhandled (`CorDebugExceptionCallbackType`) × optional condition on the exception object (reuses probe-24 member resolution). Two probe-gated unknowns before Engineering:
  - [x] **probe 26 DONE** (finding 36): `ICorDebugManagedCallback2::Exception` **fires** on macOS/ARM64 CoreCLR — the runtime invokes it, the pump classifies it as a **stopping** event carrying the `CorDebugExceptionCallbackType` (`ExceptionStopKind`), and the thrown type resolves from the live exception (`ICorDebugThread.GetCurrentException`@10 → runtime class → `MetadataResolver.TypeNameFromToken`) with no hardcoding. `ProbeException` caught at FirstChance, 2/2 + an in-process unit test (22 pass). `GetCurrentException`@10 + the `CorDebugExceptionCallbackType` values verified from cordebug.idl. "Stopping" is pump classification, not user-halt policy — the filter/condition gate lives in the policy layer above (same as conditional breakpoints).
  - [x] **probe 27 DONE** (finding 37): func-eval **works at an Exception stop**. `get_Code` func-eval'd on the in-flight `ProbeException` (its value from `GetCurrentException`, not a local) returned 42, 2/2. Pure composition of probe 26 (exception stop) + probe 24 (general member resolution) + probe 23 (eval re-entrancy); one new method `DebugSession.TryEvalCurrentExceptionMember` + `ExceptionInspector.CurrentExceptionValue`. The IDL clear-and-restore behavior is why it works. **Conditional exception breakpoints (`ex.Code == 42`) are mechanically complete** (type filter × first-chance/unhandled × condition × action). Remaining: string-returning members (`ex.Message`) await the reference-result/`ICorDebugType` path; the walker needs an `ex.`-rooted operand source (same class as `this`-from-arguments).

## Validation

This ADR moved to Accepted because the PoC validated the approach. DrHook.Engine is **complete** when:
- `DrHook.Core` has zero spawns of netcoredbg (the substrate-independence bar).
- `Microsoft.Diagnostics.NETCore.Client` (managed) + `libdbgshim` (native asset) remain the only diagnostics dependencies, both per ADR-009.
- All DrHook MCP tools pass integration tests against the engine.
- macOS/ARM64 stepping works end-to-end; func-eval decision recorded.
- Testability per [`docs/limits/drhook-testability.md`](../../limits/drhook-testability.md): in-process synthetic targets + callback-fixture replays as the primary surface.
- Engine line-count comparable to Mercury/Minerva substrate work — native interop is not a license for bloat.
