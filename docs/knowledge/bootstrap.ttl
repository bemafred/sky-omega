# This is the readonly foundation loaded into a fresh Mercury store.
# It provides grounded context so the first session doesn't start from nothing.
#
# This file is NOT an ontology. It records what is known and validated.
# It grows by extraction from real use, not by design.
#
# Status: Emergence — minimal seed, expected to grow.
