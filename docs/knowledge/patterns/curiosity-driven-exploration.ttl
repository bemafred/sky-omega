# =============================================================================
# Curiosity-Driven Exploration Pattern
# =============================================================================
#
# Curated from docs/scratches/reasoning/patterns/curiosity-pattern.ttl.
# Describes the systematic investigation of knowledge gaps — a meta-pattern
# for how an agent (human or AI) identifies what it doesn't know and
# directs attention toward reducing uncertainty.
#
# This pattern maps directly to EEE's Emergence phase: the systematic
# search for doors (knowledge gaps) before deciding which to open.
#
# Status: Validated through session use. Broadly applicable.

    rdfs:comment "A meta-pattern for investigating areas where knowledge is incomplete, uncertain, or evolving. The agent identifies known unknowns and directs attention toward reducing them — not randomly, but with purpose. This is Emergence as a discipline, not as wandering." ;

    rdfs:comment "A recognized area of incomplete understanding. Classification matters: unknown unknowns become known unknowns through attention, then known knowns through investigation. The pattern applies to the transition from unknown to known." .

    rdfs:label "Curious observation" ;
    rdfs:comment "The initial noticing that something is unknown or uncertain. This is the trigger for the pattern — it converts an unknown unknown into a known unknown by the act of noticing." ;

    rdfs:comment "Directed attention toward a knowledge gap. Not exhaustive search — focused inquiry that aims to reduce uncertainty enough to make a decision. The result may be understanding, or it may be a better-defined question." ;

    rdfs:comment "Sometimes exploration doesn't answer the original question but produces a more precise question. This is progress — a better-defined unknown is more tractable than a vague one." .

    rdfs:comment "Exploration often reveals unexpected relationships between concepts. These connections are valuable even when they don't directly answer the motivating question." .
