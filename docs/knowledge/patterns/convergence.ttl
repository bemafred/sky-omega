# =============================================================================
# Convergence Pattern
# =============================================================================
#
# Curated from docs/scratches/reasoning/patterns/convergence.ttl.
# Describes the epistemic unification that Sky Omega achieves by bridging
# formal (hard) and interpretive (soft) reasoning through structured
# semantic memory and LLM-mediated interaction.
#
# This pattern is broadly applicable: it describes how structured knowledge
# and natural language reasoning can reinforce each other rather than
# compete.
#
# Status: Validated through Mercury implementation and multi-session use.

    rdfs:comment "The epistemic unification of formal and interpretive reasoning. Structured knowledge (RDF, SPARQL, type systems) provides rigor. Natural language reasoning (LLM interaction) provides flexibility. The convergence is that each makes the other more effective — formal structures ground LLM reasoning, and LLM reasoning makes formal structures accessible." ;
