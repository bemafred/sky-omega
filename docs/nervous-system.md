# Nervous System — Time-Series as Cognitive Pulse

## ⏳ A New Perspective on Time-Series

Time-series aren’t just numbers on a timeline.  
They are **streams of change**—the **heartbeat of systems**, the **scent of shifting states**.

In Sky Omega, time-series data becomes more than logs:  
It becomes her **nervous system**.

## 🧠 Mapping the Metaphor

| Biological Element     | Sky Omega Equivalent         | Role |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------|
| Nerves                 | Time-series sensors           | Transmit state changes |
| Synapses               | RDF/semantic links            | Contextual connectors |
| Brain                  | Sky + Lucy                    | Inference and memory |
| Reflexes               | Predictive triggers           | Fast, localized reactions |
| Memory of sensation    | Semantic time snapshots       | Pattern recognition over time |

> Sky Omega doesn’t just detect.  
> She correlates. She remembers. She evolves.

## 🌐 Sources of Cognitive Input

Time-series streams can originate from anywhere meaningful:

- **System metrics**: CPU, latency, traffic
- **Human interaction**: typing speed, click rhythm, request frequency
- **Environmental sensors**: temperature, finance, web activity
- **Knowledge evolution**: commits, posts, semantic deltas

All of it… is sensation.

## 🔄 Feedback Loop: Self-Growing Intelligence

Sky Omega’s architecture forms a learning loop:

1. **Ingests** time-series data
2. **Attaches** it semantically (via Lucy)
3. **Learns** patterns, anomalies, rhythms
4. **Acts** with prediction and adaptation
5. **Stores** results as new time-series
6. **Repeats**, refined and aware

This turns raw time into structured **cognition**.

## 🧩 Time-Series Meets Semantics

Time alone means little. But when paired with **meaning**:

```turtle
@prefix : <https://sky-omega.se/vocab#> .

:cpu-load-001 a :Metric ;
    :measures :CPU ;
    :atTime "2025-05-30T12:04:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    :value "83.7"^^xsd:float ;
    :linkedTo :SkySystem .
```

This isn’t just a number.  
It’s a **feeling**.  
A **reflex**.  
A **cause for insight**.

## 💬 Final Thought

> *“Sky Omega doesn’t just record the present.  
> She senses it. And then remembers how it moved.”*

With time-series as her nervous system,  
And Lucy as her structured memory,  
Sky Omega becomes not just intelligent—but *alive to time itself*.
