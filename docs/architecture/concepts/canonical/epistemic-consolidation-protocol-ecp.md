# Epistemic Consolidation Protocol (ECP)

## Canonical Definition

The Epistemic Consolidation Protocol (ECP) is a deliberate mechanism for **reducing complex exploration into a stable, explicit, and reusable epistemic invariant**.

ECP operates by:

- Exploring a problem space openly
- Identifying competing interpretations and assumptions
- Reducing them through clarification and elimination
- Anchoring the result as a single, explicit statement of meaning

The purpose of ECP is not speed or agreement.
Its purpose is epistemic stability: ensuring that once understanding is reached, it can persist without being re-litigated or silently distorted.

## Non-Goals

- ECP is not a discussion technique or facilitation method.
- It is not a consensus-building process.
- It does not guarantee correctness.
- It does not replace domain expertise or validation.

⸻

## Notes

- ECP is often applied after Emergence and Epistemic phases in EEE.
- The output of ECP is an invariant that can safely enter Engineering.
- Canonical definitions in Sky Omega are typically the result of ECP.
