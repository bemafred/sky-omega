# SPARQL

## Canonical Definition

SPARQL is a **query language for interrogating RDF-based semantic data**.

It allows systems to ask structured questions about:

- Explicit facts
- Relationships between concepts
- Patterns of meaning across a semantic graph

Within Sky Omega, SPARQL is used to **query structured meaning**, not merely to retrieve data. It enables reasoning, validation, and inspection of semantic memory.

---

## Non-Goals
- SPARQL is not a general-purpose programming language.
- It is not limited to performance-oriented data retrieval.
- It does not infer meaning on its own.
- It is not required for all uses of RDF.

---

## Notes
- SPARQL complements RDF by making semantic structures operational.
- It supports traceability and explainability of results.
- Lucy uses SPARQL-compatible querying to reason over stored meaning.
