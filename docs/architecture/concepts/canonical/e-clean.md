# E-Clean

## Canonical Definition

E-Clean (Epistemically Clean) is an architectural stance that requires **epistemic clarity and legitimacy before, during, and after engineering**.

The E in E-Clean stands for *Epistemically*.

An E-Clean system maintains a strict separation between:

- What is known to be true
- What is assumed but unverified
- What is unknown
- What is undecidable

This separation is not temporary. It is actively preserved as systems evolve.

E-Clean does not prescribe what to build.
It governs **when structure, optimization, and automation are epistemically legitimate**, and enforces that illegitimate certainty is never silently encoded into architecture, code, or documentation.

## Non-Goals

- E-Clean is not a development methodology.
- It is not a delivery process or governance framework.
- It does not guarantee correctness or success.
- It does not eliminate uncertainty or human judgment.

---

## Notes

- E-Clean applies continuously, not just upfront.
- Violations of E-Clean often appear as premature abstractions, over-generalized models, or undocumented assumptions.
- E-Clean is a prerequisite for Semantic Architecture and meaningful use of EEE.
