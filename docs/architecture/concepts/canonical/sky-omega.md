# Sky Omega

## Canonical Definition

Sky Omega is a composed intelligence system whose purpose is to integrate fluent language interaction, structured semantic memory, and deliberate cognitive orchestration into a single, coherent whole.

Sky Omega is not a product, framework, or chatbot.
It is an architectural system in which:

- Sky provides language, dialogue, and interpretive fluency
- Lucy provides persistent, queryable semantic memory
- James provides judgment, attention, execution, and strategy
- Mira provides the human-facing interface layer

Together, these components form a system capable of structured intelligence: intelligence grounded in explicit meaning, traceable knowledge, and deliberate reasoning rather than opaque statistical behavior.

Sky Omega treats meaning as infrastructure, memory as first-class, and cognition as orchestrated, not emergent by accident.

## Non-Goals

- Sky Omega is not an attempt to simulate human consciousness.
- Sky Omega is not a claim about biological intelligence.
- Sky Omega is not a replacement for human judgment or responsibility.
- Sky Omega is not a single model, API, or vendor-dependent system.

## Notes

- Sky Omega is the **epistemic root** of all derived documentation and demonstrations.
- Public narratives and reference architectures must derive their meaning from Sky Omega, never redefine it.
- The system is intentionally designed to remain valid across model generations and tooling changes.
