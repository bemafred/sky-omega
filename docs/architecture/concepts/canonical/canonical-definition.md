# Canonical Definition

## Canonical Definition

A Canonical Definition is an **explicit, authoritative statement of meaning** that serves as the single source of truth for a concept within a system.

A canonical definition:

- Fixes the intended meaning of a concept
- Makes assumptions and scope explicit
- Prevents silent reinterpretation over time
- Establishes epistemic authority

Canonical definitions are not descriptive summaries.
They are **normative anchors** against which documentation, implementation, and evolution are measured.

---

## Non-Goals

- A canonical definition is not exhaustive documentation.
- It is not a tutorial or explanation for all audiences.
- It does not guarantee correctness or permanence.
- It does not prevent deliberate change.

---

## Notes

- Canonical definitions are typically the result of Epistemic Consolidation (ECP).
- Changing a canonical definition is a conscious epistemic act, not an incidental edit.
- Canonical definitions are a primary defense against semantic drift.
