# Structured Intelligence

## Canonical Definition

Structured Intelligence is a form of intelligence grounded in **explicit structure, traceable meaning, and deliberate reasoning**.

Unlike intelligence that relies primarily on implicit statistical behavior, structured intelligence operates over:

- Explicit representations of meaning
- Persistent, inspectable memory
- Clearly separated roles for language, memory, judgment, and interaction

Structured intelligence makes it possible to ask not only *what* a system produces, but:

- Why it knows something
- Where that knowledge came from
- How conclusions were reached
- What assumptions are in play

It treats intelligence as an **architectural composition**, not as a monolithic model or emergent artifact.

## Non-Goals

- Structured intelligence is not a claim about human cognition.
- It is not a synonym for artificial general intelligence.
- It does not assume correctness, objectivity, or completeness.
- It does not eliminate uncertainty or error.

## Notes

- Structured intelligence prioritizes epistemic integrity over fluency.
- It enables systems that are debuggable, governable, and evolvable.
- Sky Omega is an implementation of structured intelligence, not its definition.
