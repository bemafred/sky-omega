# Inspect & Adapt

## Canonical Definition

Inspect & Adapt is a deliberate practice for **examining reality as it is, rather than as it was assumed to be**, and adjusting understanding and structure accordingly.

In the context of Sky Omega and Semantic Architecture, Inspect & Adapt is used to:

- Surface mismatches between assumptions and observed behavior
- Expose hidden uncertainty or invalidated beliefs
- Re-establish epistemic legitimacy before further engineering

Inspect & Adapt is not about optimization.
It is about **restoring epistemic alignment** when drift has occurred.

----

## Non-Goals
- Inspect & Adapt is not a delivery ceremony.
- It is not a retrospective focused on process improvement.
- It does not guarantee convergence or consensus.
- It is not limited to agile or iterative development contexts.

----

## Notes
- Inspect & Adapt is most effective when guided by EEE and E-Clean.
- It applies equally to technical systems, documentation, and organizational structures.
- The outcome of Inspect & Adapt is often renewed Epistemic work, not immediate Engineering.
