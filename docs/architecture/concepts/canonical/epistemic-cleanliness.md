# Epistemic Cleanliness

## Canonical Definition

Epistemic Cleanliness is the **property** of a system in which **claims, assumptions, and knowledge are kept explicitly distinguishable**.

A system is epistemically clean when it is always possible to determine:

- What is asserted as known
- What is assumed or provisional
- What is derived and how
- What has been retracted or invalidated

Epistemic cleanliness is not about correctness.
It is about **honesty of knowledge state** and resistance to silent drift from uncertainty into false certainty.

## Non-Goals

- Epistemic cleanliness does not guarantee truth.
- It does not prevent mistakes or flawed reasoning.
- It does not replace validation, testing, or scientific method.
- It is not a stylistic preference.

---

## Notes

- E-Clean is the architectural stance that enforces epistemic cleanliness.
- Epistemic cleanliness is observable in both documentation and system behavior.
- Loss of epistemic cleanliness is a primary source of systemic brittleness.
