# Canonical Concepts

This directory serves as the **Single Source of Truth** for the conceptual definitions within the Sky Omega ecosystem.

The documents herein are **not** implementation details, transient design notes, or retrospective logs. They are **Canonical Definitions**: authoritative declarations of what a concept *is*, *is not*, and *why it exists*.

## 1. The Meta-Definition
Before reading other definitions, one must understand the format and authority of a canonical definition itself.

*   [**Canonical Definition**](canonical-definition.md) – Defines what constitutes a canonical definition, establishing the separation between "what is known" (Canon) and "how it is built" (Engineering).

## 2. The System
*   [**Sky Omega**](sky-omega.md) – The composed intelligence system itself. The epistemic root of all other definitions.

## 3. The Cognitive Architecture (Personas)
The distinct functional personas that compose the intelligent behavior of the system. These are not autonomous agents, but specialized faculties of a single composed intelligence.

*   [**James**](james.md) – The cognitive orchestration engine (Judgment, Attention, Execution, Strategy).
*   [**Lucy**](lucy.md) – The structured semantic memory system (RDF-grounded knowledge).
*   [**Sky**](sky.md) – The language and interaction component (LLM connectivity and fluency).
*   [**Mira**](mira.md) – The human-facing interface and observation layer.

## 4. Technical Substrates
The foundational layers that provide computation and storage capabilities to the personas.

*   [**Mercury**](mercury.md) – The high-performance semantic data substrate (Triple/Quad store).
*   [**Minerva**](minerva.md) – The local LLM orchestration and inference substrate.

## 5. Epistemic Foundations
The philosophical and architectural stances that govern *how* we think about the system.

*   [**E-Clean (Epistemically Clean)**](e-clean.md) – The architectural stance requiring strict separation of knowns, unknowns, and assumptions.
*   [**EEE (Emergence, Epistemic, Engineering)**](eee-emergence-epistemic-engineering.md) – The lens distinguishing exploration, clarification, and construction.
*   [**Structured Intelligence**](structured-intelligence.md) – Intelligence grounded in explicit structure and traceable meaning, rather than statistical probability.
*   [**Epistemic Cleanliness**](epistemic-cleanliness.md) – Detailed elaboration on maintaining epistemic hygiene.
*   [**Epistemic Consolidation Protocol (ECP)**](epistemic-consolidation-protocol-ecp.md) – The protocol for moving knowledge from transient states to permanent structure.

## 6. Semantic Architecture & Mechanics
Concepts related to how meaning is structured, moved, and preserved.

*   [**Semantic Architecture**](semantic-architecture.md) – Designing systems where meaning is a first-class structural concern.
*   [**Semantic Braid**](semantic-braid.md) – The interwoven, ephemeral context structure (Human Input + LLM Response + Tool Output + Semantic Control).
*   [**Semantic Core**](semantic-core.md) – The immutable nucleus of domain concepts.
*   [**Semantic Drift**](semantic-drift.md) – The phenomenon of meaning diverging from its original definition, and how to manage it.
*   [**Semantic Registry**](semantic-registry.md) – The authoritative catalog of semantic definitions.
*   [**Domain Catalog**](domain-catalog.md) – The inventory of distinct business or technical domains.
*   [**Business Domain**](business-domain.md) – Definitions specific to the core business logic and rules.
*   [**Technical Domain**](technical-domain.md) – Definitions specific to the technical implementation layer.

## 7. Technical Standards & Formats
Canonical definitions of external standards as they are applied within Sky Omega.

*   [**RDF**](rdf.md) – Resource Description Framework; the atomic unit of memory.
*   [**SPARQL**](sparql.md) – The query language for semantic memory.
*   [**Turtle**](turtle.md) – The terse syntax for RDF.

## 8. Process & Evolution
*   [**Inspect & Adapt**](inspect-adapt.md) – The feedback loops enabling system evolution.
*   [**Canonical Authoring Queue**](canonical-authoring-queue.md) – The mechanism for proposing and refining new definitions.
