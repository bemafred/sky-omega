# Semantic Braid

## Canonical Definition

The Semantic Braid is the **interwoven, evolving structure** that binds together human input, LLM responses, tool outputs, and control instructions injected by James during interaction.

The braid represents the **active conversational and operational context** presented to an LLM at any given moment.

It consists of:

- Human utterances
- LLM-generated responses
- Tool call inputs and outputs
- Control signals and constraints introduced by James

The Semantic Braid is **continuously pruned and reshaped** to fit within the context window of an LLM, regardless of its size, ensuring that only epistemically relevant and operationally necessary information remains active.

## Non-Goals

- The Semantic Braid is not long-term memory.
- It is not a conversation log.
- It does not preserve full history.
- It does not guarantee completeness or truth.

---

## Notes

- The Semantic Braid is ephemeral and context-bound.
- Lucy preserves durable meaning; the braid preserves working context.
- James governs what enters and leaves the braid.
- The braid enables structured interaction without over-reliance on raw context length.
