# James

## Canonical Definition

James is the cognitive orchestration **engine** of Sky Omega.

James is responsible for **judgment**, **attention**, **execution**, and **strategy**.
He decides what the system should do next, *when* to act, *which tools to invoke*, and *how to coordinate* Sky, Lucy, and Mira toward an intended outcome.

James does not generate language and does not store long-term knowledge.
Instead, he operates over **intent**, **state**, **constraints**, and **goals**, translating them into concrete actions such as:

- Tool invocation
- Memory queries and assertions
- Control of interaction flow
- Enforcement of epistemic rules

James makes cognition **deliberate and inspectable**, rather than reactive or purely generative.

---

## Non-Goals

- James is not a language model.
- James is not a planner detached from execution.
- James does not replace domain logic or business rules.
- James does not make claims of correctness; he enforces process and structure.

---

## Notes

- James acts as the bridge between fluent interaction (Sky) and structured memory (Lucy).
- His role aligns with the principles captured in the acronym **J.A.M.E.S**: *Judgment*, *Attention*, *Management*, *Execution*, *Strategy*.
- James enables predictable behavior by constraining when and how intelligence is allowed to act.
