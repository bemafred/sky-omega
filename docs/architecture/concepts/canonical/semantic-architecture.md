# Semantic Architecture

## Canonical Definition

Semantic Architecture is an architectural approach in which **meaning is treated as a first-class structural concern**.

In a semantic architecture, systems are designed around:

- Explicit representations of meaning
- Stable conceptual boundaries
- Traceable relationships between concepts
- Clear separation between semantics and technical implementation

Rather than encoding meaning implicitly in code structure or behavior, semantic architecture **makes meaning explicit**, inspectable, and evolvable.

Semantic Architecture enables systems to reason about, validate, and evolve their own conceptual models without conflating them with infrastructure or tooling concerns.

## Non-Goals

- Semantic Architecture is not a modeling technique or notation.
- It is not a requirement to use any specific technology or storage format.
- It is not equivalent to domain-driven design, though it may incorporate it.
- It does not remove complexity; it makes complexity visible.

---

## Notes

- Semantic Architecture relies on E-Clean to ensure that meaning is legitimate before it is structured.
- It creates the conditions necessary for structured intelligence.
- Sky Omega and VGR.Demo.Domain are concrete manifestations of semantic architecture, not its definition.
