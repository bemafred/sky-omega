# Domain Catalog

## Canonical Definition

A Domain Catalog is a **structured, explicit inventory of the concepts that make up a Semantic Core**.

It provides a discoverable view of:

- Canonical business concepts
- Their definitions
- Their relationships
- Their current status and scope

The Domain Catalog does not create meaning.
It **exposes and stabilizes** meaning that has already been established in the Semantic Core, making it accessible to humans, tools, and systems.

---

## Non-Goals

- A Domain Catalog is not a data dictionary.
- It is not an API specification.
- It does not replace domain models or code.
- It does not introduce new concepts on its own.

---

## Notes

- The Domain Catalog serves as an interface to the Semantic Core.
- It supports governance, communication, and tooling.
- In Sky Omega, Domain Catalogs are designed to be machine-readable as well as human-readable.
