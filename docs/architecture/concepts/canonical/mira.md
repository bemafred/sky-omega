# Mira

## Canonical Definition

Mira is the **embodied integration surface** of Sky Omega.

Mira provides the **interfaces through which the system both perceives and expresses itself**, spanning human-facing interaction and system-facing integration. She functions as the system’s **body**: a broad, extendable surface that connects cognition and memory to external environments.

Mira is responsible for:

- Translating internal system state and intent into perceivable form
- Receiving input from humans and external systems
- Integrating modalities such as text, voice, visuals, events, and sensors
- Exposing system capabilities through stable interaction surfaces

Mira enables presence not by reasoning, but by faithful embodiment of what the system is, knows, and is doing.

## Non-Goals

- Mira does not make decisions or judgments.
- Mira does not store semantic memory.
- Mira does not invent meaning or certainty.

## Notes

- Mira connects Sky Omega to the world, both human and technical.
- The set of interfaces Mira provides is intentionally open and extensible.
- Mira remains subordinate to James for control flow and to Sky for language generation.
- Mira reinforces trust by making system behavior observable rather than implicit.
