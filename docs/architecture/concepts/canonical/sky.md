# Sky

## Canonical Definition

Sky is the **language and interaction component** of Sky Omega, responsible for connecting to local and/or remote Large Language Models (LLMs).

Sky provides:

- Language generation and interpretation
- Conversational continuity
- Prompt construction and response decoding

Sky does not decide what should be asked or when.
It executes linguistic interaction **under the direction of James**, using context supplied through the *Semantic Braid*.

Sky treats LLMs as **replaceable substrates**, not authorities.
Its responsibility is fluency and interpretation, not judgment, memory, or epistemic legitimacy.

## Non-Goals

- Sky is not a cognitive decision-maker.
- Sky does not own system goals or intent.
- Sky does not store long-term memory.
- Sky does not determine epistemic validity.

---

## Notes

- Sky may connect to local and/or remote LLMs interchangeably.
- LLM choice, size, and provider are treated as technical concerns.
- Sky’s behavior is constrained by James and informed by Lucy.
- Sky enables fluent interaction without becoming an epistemic authority.
