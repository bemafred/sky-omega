# RDF (Resource Description Framework)

## Canonical Definition

RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a **formal model for representing meaning as explicit relationships**.

RDF expresses knowledge as triples — subject, predicate, object — enabling facts and relationships to be:

- Explicit
- Composable
- Queryable
- Traceable

Within Sky Omega, RDF is used as a *semantic substrate* for structured memory, not as an end in itself.

## Non-Goals

- RDF is not a database.
- It is not a storage engine or persistence strategy.
- It is not a guarantee of correctness or truth.
- It is not required for all semantic architectures.

---

## Notes

- RDF aligns naturally with the goals of epistemic cleanliness and traceable meaning.
- It supports evolution of knowledge without schema lock-in.
- Lucy uses RDF-compatible structures to represent semantic memory.
