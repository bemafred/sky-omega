# Lexicon: Explorative|Emergent Epistemic Engineering (EEE)

## 💡 Key Terms

### Explorative|Emergence Epistemic Engineering (EEE)
> The discipline of designing systems that represent, monitor, and evolve their knowledge structures via explicit reasoning patterns.

### Curiosity Axiom
> A machine-readable rule that triggers observation, learning, or monitoring behaviors when encountering a Known Unknown.

### Cognitive Axiom
> A rule, expressed semantically, that governs self-awareness, version tracking, or internal state management in a reasoning system.

### Semantic Reflex
> An immediate, automatic system response to a classified state or change in knowledge, such as the detection of a new version or missing citation.

### Exploration Loop
> A scheduled or reactive process that reviews unresolved questions, tracks version drift, or triggers research behavior.

### Known Unknown
> A gap in knowledge that the system can articulate and structure, triggering a reflex or exploration.

### Omega Pattern
> A formalized RDF/Turtle structure defining recurring semantic behaviors, reasoning patterns, or structural insights.

## 🔄 The EEE Duality
EEE operates as a recursive cognitive loop consisting of two primary vectors:

1. **Explorative (Active Vector):** The intentional "Fast Path" pursuit of truth. Driven by Curiosity Axioms to bridge Known Unknowns.
2. **Emergent (Structural Vector):** The evolutionary "Deep Path" consolidation. Driven by Cognitive Axioms to reshape the substrate (e.g., via Service Window compaction of RDF-substrate).
