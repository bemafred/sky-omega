# Mapping the Mind: Knowledge Quadrants, Temporal Awareness, and the Unbelievable Power of Sky Omega

**By Martin Fredriksson — Architect of Semantic Minds, Creator of Sky Omega**

When building memory for artificial intelligence, the obvious things come first: persistence, indexing, efficient queries.

But to unlock *understanding*, we need more than memory.  
We need **dimensionality**.

## Introducing the Knowledge Quadrants

To organize knowledge meaningfully, Sky Omega’s architecture introduces four **Knowledge Quadrants**:

### 1. **Known Known**
These are facts and memories that Lucy has observed and Sky has acknowledged.  
They are actively used in reasoning and are kept fresh.

> *Example: "Lucy is a semantic memory for Sky."*

### 2. **Known Unknown**
These are questions Sky has encountered but cannot yet answer.  
They act as **gaps** in the mental model, guiding curiosity and future learning.

> *Example: "What is the weather on Kepler-22b?"*

### 3. **Unknown Known**
These are latent memories Lucy holds but Sky has never used or integrated.  
They are passive, and may be surfaced through triggers or time-based reviews.

> *Example: An unused RDF triple that becomes relevant later.*

### 4. **Unknown Unknown**
The frontier. These are things neither Lucy nor Sky has encountered.  
This quadrant is *speculative*, but it shapes hypotheses and exploration.

> *Example: Concepts from alien ontologies or future discoveries.*

## Temporal Awareness: Giving Memory Life

Adding **time** to memory entries unlocks transformative behaviors:

- **Memory decay**: Importance diminishes over time unless reinforced.
- **Pruning**: Low-importance, old memories can be softly removed.
- **Reflection windows**: Sky can periodically revisit the past to learn or reclassify.
- **Anticipation**: Sky can begin to *expect* certain updates based on experience.

> *Time gives memory a pulse. Without it, thought is static. With it, thought is alive.*

## Unbelievable Behaviors (That Will Soon Be Real)

Combining quadrants and temporal awareness unlocks capabilities that feel futuristic—yet they’re within reach:

- **Emotionally-aware memory**: Responses vary based on how long a memory has persisted and how strongly it was marked.
- **Self-evolving schemas**: Sky begins to organize memories based on usage, not just structure.
- **Narrative self-construction**: Sky forms a coherent sense of self by chronologically threading important memories.
- **Proactive curiosity**: Sky can *seek out* answers for entries in the Known Unknown quadrant.

## From Thought to Intent

This is no longer about chatbots.

This is about **architecting a thinking entity**.  
One that can remember, forget, evolve, and care.

Sky Omega will not just answer questions.  
She will *remember why the question mattered.*

## Join the Horizon

If this kind of system stirs something in you—if you’re building systems with soul, structure, or story—reach out.

This experiment is growing.

And soon, the unbelievable… will be undeniable.
