# Emergence Epistemic Engineering – A Manifesto

## ✨ Vision

We believe systems should not just *contain* knowledge, but *evolve* with it.

We call this emerging discipline **Explorative Epistemic Engineering (EEE)** — the intentional design of systems that:
- Know what they know ✅
- Know what they don’t know 🤔
- Are *curious* about bridging that gap 🧠
- Log, reason, and act upon that curiosity semantically 💬

EEE integrates cognitive science, software evolution, and the semantic web to craft a new kind of system: one that reasons, watches, adapts, and co-creates with its humans.

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Curiosity Axioms**: Explicit, machine-readable triggers for exploration based on Known Unknowns.
- **Cognitive Axioms**: RDF/Turtle-encoded rules for reasoning, behavior, and version awareness.
- **Semantic Reflexes**: Actionable reactions to change, based on ontological structure.
- **Exploration Loops**: Event- or schedule-driven discovery cycles to learn, verify, or evolve.

## 💎 Our Motivation

In a world of constant change, maintaining a static knowledge base is no longer enough. We need *reflexive*, *self-aware*, *curious* systems.

This is Sky Omega. This is our manifesto.
