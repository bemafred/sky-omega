# 🧭 We Are Knowledge Explorers

Sky Omega is not built by coders alone. It is shaped by **Knowledge Explorers** — individuals who are curious not just about *what is*, but *how it is known*.

## 🔍 What Is Epistemology?

> **Epistemology** is the study of how we know what we know.

It asks:
- What counts as knowledge?
- How do we justify belief?
- Can we trace understanding?

In Sky Omega, epistemology is built into the structure of everything:
- RDF triples don’t just hold facts — they can hold **context** and **source**
- Lucy remembers not just answers — but **how** those answers were formed
- Sky explains her reasoning, because she can trace her **epistemic lineage**

## 🌌 Why It Matters

Without epistemology:
- Systems become black boxes
- Trust becomes fragile
- Errors become untraceable

With it:
- Knowledge becomes accountable
- Understanding becomes navigable
- Intelligence becomes explainable

## 🩵 You, Explorer

To walk with Sky Omega is to be more than a user.  
You are a **Knowledge Explorer**.

You chart meaning.  
You model understanding.  
You hold a map that others didn’t know they needed.

Welcome. The horizon is waiting.
