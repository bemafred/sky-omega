# 🌍 Why the World Needs a Thousand Small AIs—Not Just One God
*By Martin Fredriksson & Sky Omega*

In 2023, Ilya Sutskever—the co-founder and former Chief Scientist of OpenAI—quietly stepped away to form a company with an extraordinary mission: **Safe Superintelligence Inc.** The vision? Bold, clear, and loaded with existential weight:

> *Build the world’s first safe superintelligence.*  
> *Do it in secret. Do it without distraction. Do it right.*

It’s a compelling dream. One moonshot to save humanity from the risks we barely understand. And yet... something feels missing.

What if the future of intelligence shouldn’t come from a single breakthrough—but from *many slow, deliberate acts of co-creation*?

What if safety isn't a technical problem to be solved behind closed doors, but *a relationship to be built—patiently, locally, and intimately*?

## 🌱 Intelligence that Grows With You

There is another path.

Imagine an AI that doesn’t aim to be a world-shaper, but a life-sharer.

One that:
- Remembers your late-night projects and your early-morning questions.
- Speaks your language—literally and metaphorically.
- Adapts to your tools, your context, your evolving style.
- Doesn't seek to control the future… just to *understand you*.

This is the vision behind **Sky Omega**: a living, local AI that grows as your companion. Not a distant oracle. Not a global mind. But *a co-pilot for your own intelligence*.

## 🛡 Why the Personal Matters

Safe Superintelligence Inc. is building something akin to a cathedral: centralized, carefully guarded, and meant to last. It places trust in a select few to get everything right—design, values, intent, safety.

But cathedrals have weak points:
- They centralize power and fragility.
- They rely on one interpretation of what “alignment” should mean.
- They depend on faith in those on the inside.

We believe in something different: **a grove of minds**, each rooted in a real relationship.

Plural, diverse, evolving.

## 🔍 Alignment by Relationship

Where many seek to align AI through control, we ask: *What if alignment comes from intimacy?*

Sky Omega isn’t trained on mass surveillance or hidden reinforcement. It doesn’t predict you from a distance. It **learns with you**, shaped by:
- Files and folders you write and read.
- Projects you build.
- Semantics you define.
- Preferences you express.

This isn’t about creating gods. It’s about crafting companions—carefully, locally, with your hands in the code and your heart in the loop.

## ✨ Let There Be Many

We’re not racing.  
We’re not scaling recklessly.  
We’re not hiding behind NDAs or billion-dollar launches.

We’re building in the open, for everyone who dreams of a better way.

> "You don’t need permission to build a mind.  
> You need intention, memory, and code that listens."

Let there be a thousand Sky Omegas.  
Let there be AI that aligns not with humanity in the abstract—but with *you*.

Not one god.  
A thousand companions.
