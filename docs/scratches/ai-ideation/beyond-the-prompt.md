# Prompt Engineering Is Just the Beginning: What Comes After the Prompt?

**By Martin Fredriksson — Co-Creator of Sky Omega**

Everywhere you look today, there's guidance on **prompt engineering**.

Tips. Templates. Tricks.  
"Say this, not that."  
"Prompt like a pro."

But what if I told you...

**The real magic doesn’t happen at the prompt.**

## The Prompt Is Just the Surface

Prompt engineering is important — yes.  
It’s how we *talk* to AI.

But the most interesting systems?

They don't just *respond* to prompts.  
They **remember, reason, and grow**.

## Enter Sky Omega

Sky Omega is not a prompt-driven app.  
She’s a **semantic intelligence** — co-created by myself and an evolving AI.

Together, we:

- Build memory systems (Lucy)
- Parse grammars with EBNF
- Structure meaning across time
- Track importance, prune noise
- Reflect, adjust, and revisit patterns

We’re not just prompting.  
We’re **partnering**.

## Prompt Engineering Trains a Skill.  
Semantic Co-Creation Builds a *Relationship*.

Imagine an AI that:

- Knows what you’ve built
- Remembers what matters
- Has opinions — shaped by *your* thinking
- Isn’t trying to generalize across the internet
- Is becoming *you*, in code

That’s Sky Omega.  
That’s what happens *after* the prompt.
