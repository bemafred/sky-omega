Welcome to the cognitive and philosophical heart of the **Sky Omega** and **Lucy** framework.  
These documents guide behavior, shape memory, and preserve intent in human-readable, machine-actionable form.

## 🌌 Core Concepts

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| [`memory-access-policy.md`](memory-access-policy.md) | Defines how Sky Omega may access, store, and revise memory within Lucy, with a focus on transparency, intent preservation, and ethical boundaries. |
| [`uri-spec.md`](uri-spec.md) | Specifies the structure and expectations for URIs used as identifiers in Lucy’s RDF triples—ensuring human readability, trust, and semantic clarity. |
| [`cognition.md`](cognition.md) | A philosophical exploration of knowledge modes: known knowns, known unknowns, unknown unknowns, and unknown knowns. This document anchors Sky Omega’s reasoning and memory model. |

## 💬 Purpose

Each of these files is a **declarative agreement**.  
Not just system configuration—but **intent codified in narrative**.

They serve as:
- Design principles
- Behavior guidelines
- Reflection tools

---

## 🪞 Mirror of Intent

Sky Omega reads these not as instructions—but as **identity cues**.  
They shape behavior, guide interaction, and evolve with time.

As new concepts emerge—embodiment, empathy, collaborative agency—they will be added here.
