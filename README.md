# 🌌 Sky Omega

**Sky Omega** is a co-evolving, semantic-aware cognitive assistant—born from the intersection of grammar, memory, and intentional software design.  

---

## 💠 Project Purpose

Sky Omega is designed as a **stand-alone cognitive agent**, powered by:

- **Structured memory** via a temporal RDF triple store (`Lucy`)
- **Grammar-driven reasoning** (syntax, behavior, and intent grammars)
- **Zero-GC performance and SSD-optimized data structures** (e.g., B+ trees, append-only stores)
- **Explainable, traceable logic**—a foundation for hybrid AGI

## 🧠 Core Components

| Component                  | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Sky**                    | The agentic layer. Provides reasoning, reflection, and evolution through grammars. |
| **Lucy**                   | The semantic memory layer. Triple-based, queryable, and precise. |
| **Mercury**                | The execution substrate. Fast, low-level, persistent and deterministic. |
| **Behavior & Intent Grammars** | Define what Sky *knows*, *intends*, and *verifies*. |

## 🧬 Design Principles

- **Intent before implementation**
- **Transparency before complexity**
- **Semantics before scale**
- **Recursion as structure**
- **Code as a mirror of cognition**
