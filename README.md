# 🌌 Sky Omega

**Sky Omega** is a co-evolving, semantic-aware cognitive assistant — born from the intersection of grammar, memory, and intentional software design.  

---

## 💠 Project Purpose

Sky Omega is designed as a **stand-alone cognitive agent**, powered by:

- **Structured memory** via a temporal RDF triple store (`Lucy`)
- **Grammar-driven reasoning** (syntax, behavior, and intent grammars)
- **Zero-GC performance and SSD-optimized data structures** (e.g., B+ trees, append-only stores)
- **Explainable, traceable logic**—a foundation for hybrid AGI

## 🧠 Core Components

| Component                      | Description                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sky**                        | The language layer. Provides pruned reasoning, reflection, and short-term memory.                 |
| **James**                      | The cognitive orchestration layer. A tail recursive orchestration loop.                           |
| **Lucy**                       | The long-term memory layer. Epistemic and semantic in nature, fast, huge, queryable, and precise. |
| **Mira**                       | The integration layer. The expression and sensory capablities, UX/UI.                             |
| **Mercury**                    | The temporal RDF-substrate. Fast, huge, low-level, persistent and deterministic.                  |
| **Behavior & Intent Grammars** | Define what Sky *knows*, *intends*, and *verifies*.                                               |

## 🧬 Design Principles

- **Intent before implementation**
- **Transparency before complexity**
- **Semantics before scale**
- **Recursion as structure**
- **Code as a mirror of cognition**

## 🗂️ Navigating the Codebase

Modern IDEs (Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code) offer two views of this repository:

| View | What you see | Best for |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Solution View** | Virtual folders from `SkyOmega.sln` | Browsing by component (Mercury ADRs under Mercury, etc.) |
| **Filesystem View** | Actual directory structure | Finding files by path, understanding repository layout |

Both are valid. The solution file organizes content logically for architects and developers, while the filesystem maintains consistent paths for documentation links.
